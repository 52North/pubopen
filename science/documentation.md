# Documentation

Documentation is extremely important. Here is our short list of recommendations:

* Document from the start and use "future you" as a reference: imagine the information needed to understand a piece of code.
* Write "speaking" code, use long variable and function names, and follow [software design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) - it saves 80% of documentation.
* Use a documentation framework that suits your programming language, (a) with a version support and (b) that allows external contributions.
  * Plain text files within the code
  * **R**: [Markdown vignettes](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html)
  * **Python**: [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText)

  * [Read the Docs](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html)
  * GitHub pages
  * [Wiki hosting services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_hosting_services) on Wikipedia
