# GitHub for Education

GitHub has some offers for educational institutes. You can run classes on GitHub or put your PhD in a private repository before you publish the paper that goes with it!

So, there are basically two aspects to this, which are explained in detail on the [GitHub Education landing page](http://education.github.com/):

**For educators**: you can teach more effectively by having a platform to collect assignments, distribute starter code and discuss with students "within" their code. You can take advantage of the free Organization accounts for your classes or get in touch with GitHub to request discounts.

<i class="octicon octicon-mortar-board"></i> **For students**: you will stay organized better, won't loose your work and build a portfolio that displays your skills when you start looking for a job. And you can get more than that: the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) gives you free access to developer tools and infrastructure such as cloud hosting or domains for limited time or as long as your eligible.
