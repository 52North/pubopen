# Mindset

To understand open source development one must understand how open source developers think and work. To do that, there is no way around interacting directly with open source communities, which are as manifold and diverse as the people that engage in them.

Therefore, this section mostly points to worthwhile reading material for a rainy weekend (unless otherwise noted). Afterwards, even if you have never done "serious" software development yourself or never participated in an open source project, you will understand better the people behind it and their... quirks.

Open source has a strong relation to science and research, with many institutions using and creating open source software, but also with reasearch about open source software. We leave exploring this world to the reader using [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=de&q=open+source+software) or [Microsoft Academic Search](http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Search?query=open%20source%20software), as well as the domain of printed publications, which is quite large as well (see e.g. [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?&field-keywords=open+source+software)).

## What is Open Source?

### Definition

The OSI [defines](http://opensource.org/osd) open source as software following a set of criteria that ensure free distribution, extendability, and non-discrimination. The full criteria are online and the [annotated version](http://opensource.org/osd-annotated) is a highly recommended read. The minimal excerpt of the [definition by the Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (FSF) is as follows and is the one paragraph that you should remember.

> *<i class="octicon octicon-quote"></i> “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price.* ([source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html))

Read the full definition and try to make up your own mind about the "campaign" of the FSF, if you agree that nonfree software is really "unethical", and how FSF and OSI relate to each other.

For an optional read about the controversy defining what open source software is, please see Wikipedia [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

### History

There are plenty of descriptions of the history of open source available online, we recommend the following pages (roughly 1 hour of reading) without replicating the key events:

* ["History of free software" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_free_software)
* ["Open-source movement" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_movement)
* [History of the OSI](http://opensource.org/history)
* [The 9 most important events in Open Source history](http://royal.pingdom.com/2010/01/15/the-9-most-important-events-in-open-source-history/), including a comment thread showing that boiling down open source to "X events" is impossible

### Terms "free", "libre" and "open source"

No introduction to open source can (or should) be complete without the following famous quote by Richard Stallmann:

> *<i class="octicon octicon-quote"></i> Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer.* [source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

As you can see, "free software", "[libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre) software" and "open source software" have slightly different meanings. That might seem nit-picky to the newcomer, but these distinctions are an important part of the history and understanding of "somehow publicly available software".

Wikipedia has a useful summary of the [naming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software#Naming) and fun quotes about the unfortunate acronym *FLOSS*, as well as a whole [page discussing the ambiguity of "free"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre). In this document, when we say open source software, we mean "free and libre open source software". We might still use the acronym *FOSS*, but trust you as the now initiated reader to understand the ambiguity of the english word "free".

Extended further reading (not for one weekend): [Free as in Freedom (2.0): Richard Stallmann and the Free Software Revolution](https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/faif-2.0.pdf) by Sam Williams (book's Wikipedia page, 208 pages plus appendix!)

## Hacking

The term "hacking" or "hackers", i.e. people who hack, is part of mainstream culture today. We only want to point out that "hacking" in open source communities has diverse meanings, some of them very positive. The same skillset is required for "cracking" illegaly into secure systems and for solving a very hard informatics problem creatively. So don't worry if someone talks about a "good hack"! 

For a full history of the term and related concepts such as "white/black hat", "cracking", or "hacker ethic", see Appendix A of [Free as in Freedom (2.0): Richard Stallmann and the Free Software Revolution](https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/faif-2.0.pdf) and, as always, [Wikipedia on "Hacker"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28term%29) or [on "Hackerspace"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) (a.k.a hacklab, hackspace or makerspace).

## What is Code?

To a large extend, open source developers are no different from any other software developer. A **must read** for understanding the "software world", not only open source, and the people living and working in it, is the Story ["What is Code?" by Paul Ford for Bloomberg Businessweek](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/). From the introduction message by [Josh Tyrangiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Tyrangiel): 

> *<i class="octicon octicon-quote"></i> Software has been around since the 1940s. Which means that people have been faking their way through meetings about software, and the code that builds it, for generations. [...] a single story devoted to demystifying code and the culture of the people who make it.*

## Open Souce (Hardware)

While this book is concerned with software, we also want to point out that, (a) "Open source" also exists withouts software, and (b) if your research involves creation of hardware as well, there's a whole other world out there!

Extended reading (not included in one weekend):

* ["Open source" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) (without software)
* [History of Open Source Hardware](http://www.oshwa.org/research/brief-history-of-open-source-hardware-organizations-and-definitions/) at the Open Source Hardware Association

## The extra mile

If you really want to get into the culture of software developers and open source enthusiasts, try out any combination of the following.

* Regularly read [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/), [What if?](http://what-if.xkcd.com/), [Dilbert](http://dilbert.com/) and [Geek&Poke](http://geek-and-poke.com/) web comics so you can make conversation at lunch
* Follow technology news on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) or [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/)
* Watch [This Week in Tech](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech)
* If you're in Germany, [heise online](http://www.heise.de/) is also good to follow technology news
