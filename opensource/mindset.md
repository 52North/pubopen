# Mindset

To understand open source development one must understand how open source developers think and work.This section mostly points to worthwhile reading material for a rainy weekend (unless otherwise noted). 

Open source has a strong relation to science and research. Many institutions use and create, but also research open source software. Explore this world using [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/scholar?hl=de&q=open+source+software) or [Microsoft Academic Search](http://academic.research.microsoft.com/Search?query=open%20source%20software). See, e.g. [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?&field-keywords=open+source+software) for printed publications.

## What is Open Source?

### Definition

The OSI [defines](http://opensource.org/osd) open source as software following a set of criteria that ensure free distribution, extendibility, and non-discrimination. The full criteria are online and the [annotated version](http://opensource.org/osd-annotated) is a highly recommended read. The minimal excerpt of the [definition by the Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) (FSF) is as follows.

> *<i class="octicon octicon-quote"></i> “Free software” means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price.* ([source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html))

Read the full definition and make up your own mind about the FSF "campaign". Is nonfree software really "unethical"? How do FSF and OSI relate to each other? You can find an optional read about the controversy defining what open source software is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).

### History

There are plenty of descriptions of the history of open source available online, we recommend the following pages (roughly 1 hour of reading) without replicating the key events:

* ["History of free software" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_free_software)
* ["Open-source movement" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_movement)
* [History of the OSI](http://opensource.org/history)
* [The 9 most important events in Open Source history](http://royal.pingdom.com/2010/01/15/the-9-most-important-events-in-open-source-history/), including a comment thread showing that boiling down open source to "X events" is impossible

### Terms "free", "libre" and "open source"

No introduction to open source can (or should) be complete without the following famous quote by Richard Stallmann:

> *<i class="octicon octicon-quote"></i> Free software is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer.* [source](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

As you can see, "free software", "[libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre) software" and "open source software" have slightly different meanings. That might seem nit-picky to the newcomer, but these distinctions are an important part of the history and understanding of "somehow publicly available software".

Wikipedia has a useful summary of the [naming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software#Naming) and fun quotes about the unfortunate acronym *FLOSS*, as well as a whole [page discussing the ambiguity of "free"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre). In this document, when we say open source software, we mean "free and libre open source software". We might still use the acronym *FOSS*, but trust you as the now initiated reader to understand the ambiguity of the English word "free".

Extended further reading (not for one weekend): [Free as in Freedom (2.0): Richard Stallmann and the Free Software Revolution](https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/faif-2.0.pdf) by Sam Williams (book's Wikipedia page, 208 pages plus appendix!)

## Hacking

The term "hacking" or "hackers", i.e. people who hack, is part of mainstream culture today. We only want to point out that the term "hacking" in open source communities has diverse meanings, some of them very positive. The same skill set is required for "cracking" illegaly into secure systems and for solving a very hard informatics problem creatively. So don't worry if someone talks about a "good hack"! 

For a full history of the term and related concepts such as "white/black hat", "cracking", or "hacker ethic", see Appendix A of [Free as in Freedom (2.0): Richard Stallmann and the Free Software Revolution](https://static.fsf.org/nosvn/faif-2.0.pdf) and, as always, [Wikipedia on "Hacker"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28term%29) or [on "Hackerspace"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) (a.k.a hacklab, hackspace or makerspace).

## What is Code?

To a large extent, open source developers are no different from any other software developers. A **must read** for understanding the "software world" (not only open source) and the people living and working in it, is ["What is Code?" by Paul Ford for Bloomberg Businessweek](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/). [Josh Tyrangiel's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Tyrangiel) introduction states: 

> *<i class="octicon octicon-quote"></i> Software has been around since the 1940s. Which means that people have been faking their way through meetings about software, and the code that builds it, for generations. [...] a single story devoted to demystifying code and the culture of the people who make it.*

## Open Souce (Hardware)

While this book is concerned with software, we also want to point out that, (a) "Open source" also exists without software, and (b) if your research involves creation of hardware as well, there's a whole other world out there!

Extended reading (not a weekend read):

* ["Open source" on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) (without software)
* [History of Open Source Hardware](http://www.oshwa.org/research/brief-history-of-open-source-hardware-organizations-and-definitions/) at the Open Source Hardware Association

## The extra mile

If you really want to get into the culture of software developers and open source enthusiasts, try out any combination of the following.

* Regularly read [XKCD](http://xkcd.com/), [What if?](http://what-if.xkcd.com/), [Dilbert](http://dilbert.com/) and [Geek&Poke](http://geek-and-poke.com/) web comics so you can make conversation at lunch.
* Follow technology news on [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/) or [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/).
* Watch [This Week in Tech](https://twit.tv/shows/this-week-in-tech).
* If you're in Germany, [heise online](http://www.heise.de/) is also good to follow for technology news.
