        <p>Really, you worry about the <em>name</em>? Awesome! That means you have figured out all the other issues!</p>
        
        <p>The first thing you shold consider is: Do I really need a name for a new open source project, or would it not be better to contribute my new code to an existing and established project?</p>
        
        <p>OK OK, new project it is. Then take a look around related projects and communities within the language or framework you base your code on. Are abbreviations common? Do people use rather hip or cool names? This is also a good opportunity to check for existing names.<p>

        <p>In short:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Find a good name</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Do not use abbreviations</li>
                <li>Be a visionary and choose a name that fits the overall goal of what your code does, not a specific solution</li>
                <li>Prefer existing words from the "real world" - they are a lot easier to remember</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Search for other projects with the same name, also consider <i class="octicon octicon-law"></i> trademarks (potentially from completely different applications)</li>
            <li>If a project exists, start from the beginning</li>
        </ul>
