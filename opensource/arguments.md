# Arguments against Open Source... and How to disprove them

## No Professional can help me if I have Problems

In most cases, the opposite is true. Several factors may even ensure a better support for open source components than you can get for closed source software.
For many open source software projects, there is a large developer community available, which communicates via the Web, mailing lists, etc. Through these resources, you can get direct first-hand support from the developers, who have written the code. When you decide to use a certain open source software package you can even evaluate in advance how these different support channels work, as most communication is extremely transparent.

Furthermore, many open source projects are backed by commercial companies. These companies usually make a business from offering professional support services for specific open source packages. They will be happy to offer you their services. Furthermore, for these support services you are not bound to one single vendor (see [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in). As the source code is open, it is possible for everyone to dive into the code and to develop fixes or enhancements. However, if you rely on proprietary software and the vendor discontinues the product, if the vendor goes out of business, or if the support contracts offered by the vendor become unattractive, you may run into a problem.


## Open Source Software means I cannot sell it

Even though an open source license does require you to publish the source code your software, there are still many ways how to sell it successfully to customers. In many cases customers are not just interested in the pure software but often they need a whole package of related material and services related to this software. Thus, you need to think about packaging an offer that is attractive for customers. This may include for example specific support agreements, enhanced documentation, help for installing/integrating the software, training, etc.
And remember that Open source software does not mean “non-commerical”! From http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html:
“’Free software’ does not mean ‘noncommercial’. A free program must be available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial distribution. Commercial development of free software is no longer unusual; such free commercial software is very important. You may have paid money to get copies of free software, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to sell copies.”


## "Linux is only for free if your Time has no Value"

This quote is taken from the following Web page: http://www.jwz.org/doc/linux.html
While it might be true that Linux requires more time to customize it to your needs, it is not true that this time is wasted. In fact, Linux, as many other open source software packages, gives you a lot more flexibility to set-up systems that fit exactly to your needs. Thus, while initially it might take more time, in the end you will have a system which allows you to work extremely efficient.

### Open Source Business Models

Non-open source business models encompass consulting, license fees, EULAs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-user_license_agreement)

...

COTS > https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_off-the-shelf


Perspective A:
* Dual-licensing
* Selling professional services
* Selling of branded merchandise
* Selling software as a service
* Partnership with funding organizations
* Voluntary donations
* Bounties
* Pre-order/crowdfunding/reverse-bounty model
* Advertising-supported software
* Selling of optional proprietary extensions
* Selling of required proprietary parts of a software product
* Re-licensing under a proprietary license
* Obfuscation of source code
* Delayed open-sourcing

Perspective B - the same as for non-free software:

* Training, Workshops, Know-how dissemination
* Installation, Maintenance
* Consultation
* Customization of interfaces and features
* Implementation of new features
* Support and Hotline at all availability levels
* Research and Development
