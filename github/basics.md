# Basics: Git, Accounts & Repositories

GitHub is a free platform for code and task management. At the core, it is based on an open source version control system (VCS) called [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

There are many tutorials to help you get started ([Getting Started Git Basics](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)). 

If you do not like to work with the command line, or - god forbid - you are not working on Linux, install Git (available for all operating systems) and a Git user interface.

<i class="octicon octicon-megaphone"></i> We **strongly recommend** to start with Git at the command line. Very experienced and intense Git users do not use an UI! It will help understand how Git works if you type commands instead of clicking fancy buttons.

Sign up - https://github.com/join - to get an account. Create your first *repository* - something like a project base folder - with a single click and you are ready to go. Or,  *fork* a repository, i.e. make a copy of an existing repository, and make the copy your own. This way your work won't affect the original project.
