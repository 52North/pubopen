# Basics: Git, Accounts & Repositories

GitHub is a free platform for code and task management. At the core it is based on an open source version control system (VCS) called [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

To get started with Git, there are many tutorials out there ([example](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)). If you are not a person to work with the command line, or good forbid you are not working on Linux, you can be completely fine with installing Git (it is available for all operating systems) and a Git user interface.

<i class="octicon octicon-megaphone"></i> However, we **strongly recommend** to start with git on the command line. There is a reason why very experienced and intesive git users do not use a UI! Also, it will help you a lot to understand how git works if you type commands instead of clicking fancy buttons.

To get an account on GitHub, simply sign up: https://github.com/join. After you singed up, you can create your first *repository*, something like a project base folder.
