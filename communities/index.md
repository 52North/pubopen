# Software Communities

In this chapter we tackle the human side of open source projects.

*How can you build a community that lasts? How can you organise a project that serves different needs, schedules and people? How can you show what your project can do? How can you get help to take your project to the next level?*

**This section is, more than others, *work in progress*.**

<!-- Read on in the sections about [Community Building](./building.md), [Project Organisation](./organisation.md), [Marketing](./marketing.md), and [Contributors](./contributors.md). -->

We have sections in the making about community building, openness, as well as marketing and public relations.
