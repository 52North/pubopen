# Introduction

*How can you publish research software as open source? And do so without too much overhead and actually gaining impact by leveraging the open source approach?*

These are the questions answered in this best practice published by the SDI team of the [GLUES](http://modul-a.nachhaltiges-landmanagement.de/de/wissenschaftliche-begleitung-glues/) project.

Collections of files are called libraries, and each library can be synced
separately. A library can be encrypted with a user chosen password. This
password is not stored on the server, so even the server admin cannot view a
file's contents.

Seafile allows users to create groups with file syncing, wiki, and discussion to
enable easy collaboration around documents within a team.
