# GitHub

GitHub is _the_ platform for open source software development. Millions of projects use it (cf. [GitHut](http://githut.info/)). The success of GitHub is thanks to its great collaboration workflow, allowing developers, documenters and users to build something together. GitHub enables the idea of social coding, a software that is developed effectively by a distributed virtual community.

Naturally, GitHub has extensive high quality online documentation: [https://help.github.com/](https://help.github.com/)

Therefore, we only give a brief overview and describe, based on our experiences, why GitHub simply "works". In each section we then link to the relevant contents of the excellent [GitHub Bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/).
