# GitHub for Education

GitHub offers educational institutes the opportunity to run classes on GitHub or put a PhD in a private repository before publishing the accompanying paper!

Two basic aspects are explained in detail on the [GitHub Education landing page](http://education.github.com/):

**Educators**: You can teach more effectively by having a platform to collect assignments, distribute starter code and discuss issues with students "within" their code. You can take advantage of the free Organization accounts for your classes or get in touch with GitHub to request discounts.

<i class="octicon octicon-mortar-board"></i> **Students**: You will stay better organized and won't loose your work. You will also build a portfolio that displays your skills once you start looking for a job. There is more: the [Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) gives you free access to developer tools and infrastructure, such as cloud hosting or domains, for a limited time or as long as you are eligible.
