# Arguments against Open Source... and How to disprove them

## No Professional can help Me if I have Problems

In most cases, the opposite is true. Several factors may even ensure a better support for open source components than for closed source software. 
For many open source software projects, there is a large developer community available. Communication takes place via the Web, mailing lists, etc. Here you can get direct, first-hand support from the developers of the code. Since most communication is extremely transparent, you can evaluate in advance how these different support channels work when deciding which open source software package to use.

Many open source projects are backed by commercial companies. These companies offer professional support services for specific open source packages. Furthermore, you are not bound to one single vendor (see [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)) for these support services. Since the source code is open, anyone can develop fixes or enhancements. However, if you rely on proprietary software and the vendor discontinues the product, goes out of business, or if the support contracts offered by the vendor become unattractive, you may run into a problem.


## Open Source Software means I cannot sell it

An open source license requires the source code to be published, however, there are many ways to sell it successfully. In many cases, customers need not only the software, but also a package of related materials and services. Thus, an attractive offer including specific support agreements, enhanced documentation, help for installing/integrating the software, training, etc. would make sense. Open Source Software does not mean “non-commerical”! 
> <i class="octicon octicon-quote"></i> ’Free software’ does not mean ‘noncommercial’. A free program must be available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial distribution. Commercial development of free software is no longer unusual; such free commercial software is very important. You may have paid money to get copies of free software, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to sell copies ([source](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)).


## "Linux is only for free if your Time has no Value" ([source](http://www.jwz.org/doc/linux.html))

While it might be true that Linux requires more time to customize it according to your needs, it is not true that this time is wasted. In fact, Linux, as do many other open source software packages, provides a lot more flexibility in setting up systems to fit your needs exactly. It might take more time initially, but you will have a system which allows you to work extremely efficiently in the end.


## You cannot earn Money with Open Source

We focus on publishing research outputs as open source software. When we talk about research, the focus is not on money, but on making the research community aware of your work, showcasing your results, and providing a basis that can be re-used and advanced by future research. There are, however, many ways to make money with open source software. The following paragraphs introduce two possible open source business models.

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation provides a [compact summary about commercial services](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Commercial_Services) for open source software. The information on this page is pretty similar to the revenue opportunities followed by vendors of proprietary software, except that there are no license fees for the software. Typical elements of such an open source business model may comprise consulting, custom developments (e.g. new or modified features) based on an open source software package, maintenance, support with specific service levels, training, etc. Open source software may help researchers successfully submit new research and development project proposals to further advance and improve their software.

Wikipedia also has [a comprehensive article on different approaches for open source business models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software). 

For example:
* Dual-licensing: Publish your software under an open source license, but for those users who can't comply with this license, sell commercial licenses. 
* Software as a service: Sell your software as a service (e.g. by providing access to your software as a cloud service). 
* Proprietary/Open Source combination: Combine your open source software with proprietary software that you might sell (e.g. proprietary extensions). 
* Other sources of revenue may comprise the sale of branded merchandise, voluntary donations, partnerships with funding organizations, [open-source bounties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_bounty), advertising-supported software, or crowdfunding.

There are many other opportunities to make money from open source software. Share your experience.


## I cannot patent my Code

Software patenting is a highly controversial topic. Depending on the country in which you live/work, it might not even be possible to patent your software.

An important factor in today's science community is to maximize the impact of your research. This is why many funding agencies start requiring publications to be open access and software to be open source. The idea of patenting code is completely contrary to these requirements and the principles of open and reproducible science.

Recommeded reading on software patents should start with [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent).
