# Scope and Goals

Research of today is driven by (sometimes large amounts of) data from various sources and of manifold aspects. Often this data is published as "open" data and within research projects. It is analyzed with general and expert software written by informaticians and domain scientists alike. The projects have a life span of 2 to 4 years. Often this software is deemed unfit for publication, although the idea of open source software is widespread. Too often though **the reason for not publishing the software is lack of time or knowledge**. This best practice will provide arguments and workflows that allow an effective and cost-worthy publication as well as long-term maintenance and management of research software as open source software.

The **target audience** are project managers, work group leaders, and scientists from all domains that use code for their research but do not publish it yet. The document provides a quick overview into relevant topics and provides references to more detailed work. The authors aim to use plain language to explain technical topics, but also introduce you to the "lingo" of open source software development. Where useful we add **Open Guides** to approach a topic from a very opinionated standpoint to answer the most relevant questions for practical applications.

On the one hand, the goal of this publication is to give research project leaders, principal investigators, and researchers a set of workflows that increase the amount of reusable open source software to optimize research and its impact, as well as arguments for negotiations with supervisors or funding agencies that argue in favour of a publication.
On the other hand, the experiences behind this work come from participation of an open source initiative and small enterprise, which uses open source software as its means of doing applied research in the geoinformatics domain, in funded research projects. These experiences are put into writing for the first time to improve the process of doing problem-driven research within such an organisation.

We cannot cover specifc programming languages or recommend specific libraries of application domains, such as hydrology, physics, or geomorphology. Please feel free to contribute such information as chapters to this document.
