# Documentation

Parts of this was mentioned before, but it is important, so here we go.

Documentation is extremely important, and you know that. So instead of telling you all the thigns that you should do but don't do anyway, here is our short list of recommendations:

* Document from the start and use "future your" as a reference: imagine the information that you need to understand a piece of code
* Write "speaking" code, use long variable and function names, and follow [software design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) - it saves 80% of the documentation.
* Use a documentation framework (that suits your programming language) with (a) version support and (b) allows external contributions
  * Plain text files witin the code
  * **R**: [Markdown vignettes](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html)
  * **Python**: [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText)
  * [Top ten reasons GitHub is a great tool for creative writers](https://medium.com/@jjmerelo/top-ten-reasons-github-is-a-great-tool-for-creative-writers-d0e8b27de71d)
  * [Read the Docs](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html)
  * GitHub pages
  * [Wiki hosting services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_hosting_services) on Wikipedia
