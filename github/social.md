# Social Coding

The reason why GitHub is so successful is simple: It makes collaboration with others easy. And it is successful collaboration between people that makes (software) projects themselves a success.

From the GitHub old mission statement ([via](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-consultant/social-coding-the-next-wave-in-development/)):

> *Code is about the people writing it. We focus on lowering the barriers of collaboration by building powerful features into our products that make it easier to contribute. The tools we create help individuals and companies, public and private, to write better code, faster.*

One of the GitHub founders, Chris Wanstrath, gave a great talk at the Esri user conference in 2014 about GitHub and open source in general, which is worth the 60 minutes of your time - [watch it here](http://video.esri.com/watch/3223/social-coding-and-the-future-of-open-source ).

After the video, start "watching" a couple of repositories and "follow" some people to stay updated. Explore some users profiles to see what people are working on and connect with the ones that use similar software or do work that is related to your own.

## If I work on my own, do I still need GitHub?

<i class="octicon octicon-megahone"></i> Yes! You could just see it as a backup solution, but the more important aspects is the following: Git improves <i class="octicon octicon-mortar-board"></i> your workflow, it encourages to wander off with new ideas (*branches*) and switch between them, and even merge them. And GitHub simply is a great user interface to Git. And just because you work on your own _now_ does not mean it will stay like that forever! On GitHub, friends or colleagues can follow your work and become collaborators.

With Git (or any VCS), you will work in plain text files and keep code and documentation closely together, which makes sure you or anybody can understand what is going on in one week, one month, or one year.
