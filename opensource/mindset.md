# Mindset

To understand open source development one must understand how open source developers think and work. To do that, there is no way around interacting directly with open source communities, which are as manifold and diverse as the people that engage in them.

Therefore this section merely points to some worthwhile reading material that you can easily spend a rainy weekend on. Afterwards, even if you have never done "serious" software development yourself or never participated in an open source project, you will understand better the people behind it.

To a large extend, open source developers are no different from any other software developer. A **must read** for understanding the "software world" and the people in it is the Story ["What is Code?" by Paul Ford for Bloomberg Businessweek](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/). From the introduction message by [Josh Tyrangiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Tyrangiel): 

*<i class="octicon octicon-quote"></i> Software has been around since the 1940s. Which means that people have been faking their way through meetings about software, and the code that builds it, for generations. [...] a single story devoted to Â­demystifying code and the culture of the people who make it.*
