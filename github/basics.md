# Basics: Git, Accounts & Repositories

GitHub is a free platform for code and task management. At the core it is based on an open source version control system (VCS) called [Git](http://git-scm.com/).

There are many tutorials out there to help you get started with Git  ([example](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)). If you do not like to work with the command line, or - god forbid - you are not working on Linux, you can be completely fine with installing Git (it is available for all operating systems) and a Git user interface.

<i class="octicon octicon-megaphone"></i> However, we **strongly recommend** to start with Git on the command line. There is a reason why very experienced and intense Git users do not use a UI! Also, it will help you a lot to understand how Git works if you type commands instead of clicking fancy buttons.

To get an account on GitHub, simply sign up: https://github.com/join. Once you have signed up, you can create your first *repository* - something like a project base folder - with a single click and you are ready to go. Or, you can *fork* a repository, i.e. make a copy of an existing one, and make the copy your own to continue the work without affecting the original project.
