# Software Development 

## Process

If you work alone or in a team, it is worth having an understanding of the software development process you apply. Knowledge about software development lifecycles can even help you to organize your research better!

Please read a bit about the software development processes (about 30 mins. of reading):

* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process
* http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/CMS-Information-Technology/XLC/Downloads/SelectingDevelopmentApproach.pdf
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development
 
Did you really just skip over the list of reading? OK then simply use **Scrum** (and read [this](https://searchpub.nssc.nasa.gov/servlet/sm.web.Fetch/scrum.pdf?rhid=1000&did=1984005&type=released) or [get it here](http://www.agilelearninglabs.com/resources/scrum-introduction/), and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_%28software_development%29)).

**Our recommendation**: Everything but an agile and iterative approach will eventually fail, or cost a lot of money and a take a lot of time, and thereby it does not work in research. Having said that, stating to yourself and you collaborators which agile approach you apply helps a lot because it gives you a _common language_ to use.


## Collaborative Software Development

Our whole life is just an endless line of *"collect, compare, decide"*, and so is software development. If you do that alone or with many people does not matter, but to successfully employ this process you need a few features, all of which are provided by the GitHub platform:

* Source code versioning
* Documentation platform
* Issue or task tracking
* Website
* (mailing list only if you use emails still...)

There are of course other source code versioning systems ([Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/), [Bazaar](http://bazaar.canonical.com/en/), [SVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/)), but Git is the real deal. *Going with the flow* makes it easier for new developers to join your project.

There are also other task management systems, and [Trello](https://www.atlassian.com/de/software/confluence) for example is great and integrates very well with GitHub. Your institution hosts [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/de/software/confluence), [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/), [Redmine](http://www.redmine.org/), or [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/)? Go for it.

You can also host websites anywhere else. Just search for website hosting :-). If you need a blog, hosting with GitHub is possible but might not be your first choice.

And of course there are also **alternatives to GitHub**, see <a href="http://alternativeto.net/software/github/">http://alternativeto.net/software/github/</a> and <a href="http://toppersworld.com/top-10-free-github-alternatives-for-private-repositories/">http://toppersworld.com/top-10-free-github-alternatives-for-private-repositories/</a>, for example BitBucket, or R-Forge. Again *going with the flow* of your language/domain will lower the entry barrier for others to collaborate with you. You can get commercial support and private repositores, or also deploy an Open Source copy using <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>
