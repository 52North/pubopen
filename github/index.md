GitHub is _the_ platform for open source software development. Millions of projects use it (cf. [GitHut](http://githut.info/)). Its success comes from its great collaboration workflow, which allows developers, documenters and users to build something together. GitHub enables the idea of social coding, a software that is developed effectively by a distributed virtual community.

GitHub provides extensive high quality online documentation: [https://help.github.com/](https://help.github.com/). Thus, we give you a brief overview and describe our opinion of why GitHub simply "works". We also link to the relevant contents of the excellent [GitHub Bootcamp](https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/).
