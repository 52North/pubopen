# Arguments against Open Source... and How to disprove them

## No Professional can help me if I have Problems

In most cases, the opposite is true. Several factors may even ensure a better support for open source components than you can get for closed source software.
For many open source software projects, there is a large developer community available, which communicates via the Web, mailing lists, etc. Through these resources, you can get direct first-hand support from the developers, who have written the code. When you decide to use a certain open source software package you can even evaluate in advance how these different support channels work, as most communication is extremely transparent.

Furthermore, many open source projects are backed by commercial companies. These companies usually make a business from offering professional support services for specific open source packages. They will be happy to offer you their services. Furthermore, for these support services you are not bound to one single vendor (see [vendor lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in). As the source code is open, it is possible for everyone to dive into the code and to develop fixes or enhancements. However, if you rely on proprietary software and the vendor discontinues the product, if the vendor goes out of business, or if the support contracts offered by the vendor become unattractive, you may run into a problem.


## Open Source Software means I cannot sell it

Even though an open source license does require you to publish the source code your software, there are still many ways how to sell it successfully to customers. In many cases customers are not just interested in the pure software but often they need a whole package of related material and services related to this software. Thus, you need to think about packaging an offer that is attractive for customers. This may include for example specific support agreements, enhanced documentation, help for installing/integrating the software, training, etc.
And remember that Open source software does not mean “non-commerical”! From http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html:
*“’Free software’ does not mean ‘noncommercial’. A free program must be available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial distribution. Commercial development of free software is no longer unusual; such free commercial software is very important. You may have paid money to get copies of free software, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to sell copies.”*


## "Linux is only for free if your Time has no Value"

This quote is taken from the following Web page: http://www.jwz.org/doc/linux.html
While it might be true that Linux requires more time to customize it to your needs, it is not true that this time is wasted. In fact, Linux, as many other open source software packages, gives you a lot more flexibility to set-up systems that fit exactly to your needs. Thus, while initially it might take more time, in the end you will have a system which allows you to work extremely efficient.


## You cannot earn Money with Open Source

In this book, we focus on publishing research outputs as open source software. And when we talk about research, the focus should not be on earning money but instead on making the research community aware of your work, showcase your results, and providing a basis that can be re-used and advanced by future research. However, there are still many ways how to make money with open source software. In the following paragraphs we will introduce two perspectives on possible open source business models.

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation provide a [compact summary about commercial services](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Commercial_Services) that can be offered in the context of open source software. When you have a look at this page, you will notice that this is pretty similar to the revenue opportunities followed by vendors of proprietary software, except that there are no license fees for the software. Typical elements of such an open source business model may comprise consulting, custom developments (e.g. new or modified features) based on an open source software package, maintenance, support with specific service levels, training, etc. And if you are a researcher, open source software may help you to successfully submit new research and development project proposals to further advance and improve your software.

On Wikipedia you can even find [a comprehensive article on different approaches for open source business models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software). 

For example, you may follow dual-licensing approach. This means that you publish your software under an open source license but for those users who may not be able to comply with this license, you can sell commercial licenses. Another approach is to sell your software as a service (e.g. by providing access to your software as a cloud service). You could also combine your open source software with other proprietary parts that you might sell (e.g. proprietary extensions). Other sources of revenue may comprise the sale of branded merchandise, voluntary donations, partnerships with funding organizations, [open-source bounties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_bounty), advertising-supported software, or crowdfunding.

There are even many further opportunities how to make money from open source software. If you would like to share your experiences, we are happy to include your contribution in this book.


## I cannot patent my Code

Patents on software are a highly controversial topic. Depending on the country where you are living/working, there might even be no way to get patents for software anyway.

If you read this book, you are likely a researcher who is working on a project that creates some software/source code as an output. An important factor in today's science community is to maximize the impact of your research. This is a reason why many funding agencies are currently starting to require publications to be open access and software to be open source. The idea of patenting your code would be completely against these requirements and the principles of open and reproducible science.

We recommend to have some further looks on the topic of software patents. The [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent) might be a good starting point. After that you should decide if software patents are really something you should consider.
