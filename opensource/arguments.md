# Arguments against open source... and how to disprove them

## No professional can help me if I have problems

The opposite is true - you have no vendor lock-in (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in).

## Open source software means I cannot sell it

From http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html 

*<i class="octicon octicon-quote"></i> "Free software" does not mean "noncommercial". A free program must be available for commercial use, commercial development, and commercial distribution. Commercial development of free software is no longer unusual; such free commercial software is very important. You may have paid money to get copies of free software, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to sell copies.*

# You cannot earn money with open source

research is not focussed on earning money
