# Software quality

*What is good software?*

You tell us. For the sake of this guide, software is good simply if it **does the job**.

Yes, we actually added a full chapter on Software quality, just to make it look like we would have a short answer for you!

If you worry about software quality, we do recommend the following:

* Publish your software as open source from the start - it will make you more aware of documentation and code "beauty", thus increase the quality.
* Use an established documentation framework
* Follow an established software development lifecycle

A longer answer can be found in any of these **further resources**:
