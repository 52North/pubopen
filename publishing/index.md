# Scientific Publishing of Data and Software

There is a growing list of papers and platforms that support the publishing of scientific data and software. As this guide is mostly concert with _creating_ the software, this section is merely a list of (partially commented) links to platforms, journals, repositories, ...

It should be noted that data is _not_ like software and while GitHub can be used for publishing and collecting data as well, you should take a look around if there are more suitable platforms. The field of publishing software and data is an active area of research itself - why not collaborate and be one of the first in your lab, institution or domain to explore this avenue?

As a final side-note: the idea of "weaving" code (one of the two aspects of [literal programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) with "tangling" being the second) and data right into a single document, for example [Sweave for R](http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/) or [Pweave for Python](http://mpastell.com/pweave/), is worth exploring for anyone using code within research, even if just for creating plots.
