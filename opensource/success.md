# Success Stories

Open source software is not a niche product. In fact, if you are reading this very book, that means that you see a product created with open source software, such as Git for collaboration and version management, Firefox for editing and most likely Apache or nginx on a Linux web server for delivery of the content to you.

There are many success stories in the open source world. You find a few examples below:
* [Apache Software Foundation](http://www.apache.org/): The Apache Software Foundation is responsible for the Apache software projects. One of the most-well known Apache projects is the Apache HTTP Server, the world's most widely used web server software. The relevance of the Apache projects become apparent if you have a look at the companies supporting the Apache Software Foundation (e.g. Google, Microsoft, IBM, Yahoo).
* [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/): This is an open source office suite published and maintained by The Document Foundation. It is based on OpenOffice.org, from which it was forked in 2010, which was originally an open-sourced version of StarOffice. LibreOffice enjoys quite a large user community and is considered a common alternative to proprietary products.
* [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux): Linux is one of the most prominent examples of open source projects. From its first release in 1991, it has become a widely used operating system. Popular platforms such as Android rely on the Linux kernel. 
* Web browsers: Two of the most popular projects rely on open source licenses. [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/) is available under the Mozilla Public License. The Chrome browser published by Google is distributed as freeware, however, significant parts of its source code are available as a project called [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) under the BSD license.

In the geospatial community, we would like to mention two projects for offering map services. Both projects contribute to/publish open source software and are at the same time the basis for a software as a service business model.
* [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/) offers services to create and host maps on the Web as a freemium service. However, interested users may access the platform implementation as an open source package to install their own instance or to modify it.
* [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/about/open/) offers similar services to CartoDB's. Significant modules of this platform have been published as open source software. Furthermore, MapBox has contributed to many other open source projects. 

An example of how different organizations needed a certain functionality can team-up in order to fund the necessary developments is the [52°North Sensor Observation Service (SOS) implementation](http://52north.org/sos). This is a Web service which allows to publish measurement data/sensor data on the Web through a standardized interface. This component is the result of several partners and (research) projects which have contributed either funding for 52° North developers or which have directly contributed code. Due to recent legal obligations, several countries needed a tool to report their air quality measurement in a standardized format to the European Environment Agency (EEA). To get the necessary enhancements of the 52°North SOS several countries (i.e. Belgium, The Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom) have teamed up to fund the development (see also http://52north.org/412-streamlining-european-air-quality-data-reporting-and-exchange-via-sos-4-3). This is an excellent example how different stakeholders can join their forces to further advance open source software.

If you are interested to learn more about different open source projects and their popularity, activities, etc., you may have a look at [Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/)). This Web site offers you different metrics to assess open source projects.

Finally, there are some nice overviews of successful open source projects available on the Web:
